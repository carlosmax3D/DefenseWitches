Reimplementation of this popular game

You can go through Readme.markdown but basically this is a project of Solar2D Native, you'll need Android studio and Solar2D binaries in order to generate al APK from your device, at the moment the game can runs but some dynamics are broken like the witches wont attack the enemy's, this is a work in progress, feel free to adapt the code as you wish.

There are also a folder called Decomp that contains the LUA compiled files, the original APK, the decompile assets and in general the original data.

Reach me out if you need something else.
